**_ Frontend Mentor Tailwind CSS FAQ Accordion _**

** Project Description **

Challenge to build a FAQs Accordion page.

** Project Brief **

- Hide/show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

** My Reflections **

This was a newbie level project with a basic layout, which I found relatively easy to build. I checked a couple of examples of how to build an accordion with JavaScript, which helped me understand better how the logic was going to work.

** Things to improve **

- Should all the open paragraphs collapse when a new question is clicked..?
- The shadow needs some adjustment regarding colour and size
- How do I implement the keyboard navigation..?
